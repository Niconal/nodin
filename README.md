NodeJS SNMP Monitoring

What can currently be done:
- Monitor different devices/ports of devices via SNMP
- Write SNMP Values to a Influx Database

What should be possible in the future (aka ToDO):
- Configuration and states are stored in Redis
- Web-Interface for Values and configuration (module will be caled nodin)
- Discover device states automatically/periodically (module will be called munin)

Where does the name come from?
Odin should be know, by the most people - otherwise: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin
Odins two birds were called hugin and munin they provided him information about the things going on around him - both names were already taken by other projects so I decided to use the a mixture of the programming language and the "master" of hugin and munin -> NodeJS + Odin = nodin
